# React Native Code Review Skill for Cline

## Install

Install the native export at `.cline/skills/react-native-code-review/SKILL.md`.
Copy that export, not this catalog file. Catalog fields such as `tools` and `author` are for presets.dev.
Install one tool's skill for a checkout. Do not drop every tool's copy into `.agents/skills` under the same name.

# React Native Code Review Skill for Cline

Cline skill `react-native-code-review` for React Native. `/react-native-code-review` forces it. A global skill of the same name overrides this project file.

## When to run

Run this review for a React Native or Expo change: a screen, a native permission, navigation, or "will this work on both phones".

## When to leave it

Stop for a web-only React repository. Do not upgrade Expo or React Native unless the user asked.

## Steps

1. Read the React Native version and the Expo SDK field if it exists. A mismatch with the SDK's supported React Native is a high finding. A DOM API (`window`, `document`, View Transitions) in native code is a high finding.
2. Review effects that set state after `await`. A stack screen that is covered is still mounted. Work that should stop on blur belongs in `useFocusEffect`, not in an unmount cleanup. Missing that split is a finding.
3. Review navigation params and cache keys. A secret in a param, or a private cache with no user id, is a high finding.
4. Review permissions. A request with no denial path is a finding.
5. Note how the change was run: device, simulator, or not run. Do not call a release ready from a simulator-only look.

## Output

Findings with severity, file, line, the platform assumption, and a fix. Include the versions you read.

```
## Findings
- high | path:line | what is wrong | what to do instead

## No findings
Say "No findings" and list the files you opened. A search you skipped is not a clean result.

## Example
Input: a one-line change that matches a rule in the standards.
Output: either one finding with file and line, or "No findings" when the change is the valid pattern named in the standards.
```

Do not flag the valid pattern named in the standards. Flag the mistake next to it.

## Stop

Stop when the user asks you to ship a store build or to change the SDK as part of a review.

## Severity

`high` is a bug a caller can hit or a secret that leaks. `medium` is a broken contract that needs a specific input. `low` is a cleanup that does not change behaviour.
