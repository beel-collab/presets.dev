# Express Security Review Skill for Antigravity CLI

Antigravity CLI skill `express-security-review` for Express. The workspace path is `.agents/skills/express-security-review/SKILL.md`. Reload skills before you expect the new command.

## When to run

Run this review for an Express router, middleware order, or an Express 4 to 5 migration.

## When to leave it

Stop for Fastify, Nest, or another framework. Do not upgrade Express unless the user asked.

## Steps

1. Read the installed Express major. On 5, an old `/*` wildcard or a regex route copied from 4 is a high finding. On 4, do not introduce 5-only syntax.
2. Walk middleware order. Auth after the route, or a body parser after the handler, is a high finding.
3. For each write, confirm a schema and an auth check. A missing one is a high finding.
4. Search for `next(err)` on a path that also sends a response. Double-send is a high finding.
5. Confirm `express.json` has a limit.
6. Run the test script only if the user asked. Otherwise write `not run`.

## Output

Findings with severity, file, line, the route, and a fix. Include the Express major.

## Stop

Stop when the user asks you to remove auth middleware to debug a route.

## Severity

`high` is a bug a caller can hit or a secret that leaks. `medium` is a broken contract that needs a specific input. `low` is a cleanup that does not change behaviour.

## Output

```
## Findings
- high | path:line | what is wrong | what to do instead

## No findings
Say "No findings" and list the files you opened. A search you skipped is not a clean result.

## Example
Input: a one-line change that matches a rule in the standards.
Output: either one finding with file and line, or "No findings" when the change is the valid pattern named in the standards.
```

Do not flag the valid pattern named in the standards. Flag the mistake next to it.

## What to check

- Injection: concatenated SQL, shell, or HTML.
- XSS: unescaped user text in HTML.
- CSRF: a browser state change with the framework check disabled.
- Secrets: a key in the repo or in a log line.
- IDOR: an id from the client with no owner or permission check.
- SSRF: a user-supplied URL fetched with no allow-list.
